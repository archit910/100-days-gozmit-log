# 100-days-gozmit-log

**I failed my first Round in less than 5 days.**
When i started this challenge, i was so much motivated and also determined to work in this 100 days to be a good developer atleast.
Later as time fly motivation dimmed and nothing looked clear and finally i stopped doing it.
## But now i am starting all over again.

## This Repository will contain all the logs of my daily work. It works round wise so I'm currently in Round 1.
